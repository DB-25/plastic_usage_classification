# Plastic Usage Classification

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to quantify the amount of plastic generated through grocery store sales. The project aims to develop a model capable of accurately classifying the amount of plastic in grocery store products using deep learning techniques.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to develop a model capable of accurately classifying the labeled product images according to the amount of plastic in them. The team will develop a set of 6,000 product images that will be classified into four categories: no-plastic, some-plastic, heavy-plastic, and no-image (not a product). In addition, they will collect 350,000 unlabeled images of products in-situ and aim to classify them according to the amount of plastic present.
